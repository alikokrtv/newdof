## Overview
This project is a full-stack application built with React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend. It utilizes SQLite as the database to store and manage data.

```

## Backend
The backend is built using Node.js and Express. It handles API requests and interacts with the SQLite database.

### Setup
1. Navigate to the `backend` directory.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Frontend
The frontend is a React application that communicates with the backend API.

### Setup
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the React application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Database
The SQLite database is located in the `database` directory. The application uses this database to store data.

## Example Components
The frontend includes example components located in `frontend/src/components/`:
- `ExampleComponent1.jsx`
- `ExampleComponent2.jsx`

## Usage
Once both the backend and frontend are running, you can access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
