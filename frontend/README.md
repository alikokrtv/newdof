## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node package manager)
- SQLite

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-react-app
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies:
   ```
   cd backend

   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:
   ```
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```

2. Start the frontend application:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

### Usage
- The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:5000` (or the port specified in `server.js`).
- The frontend application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Example Components
